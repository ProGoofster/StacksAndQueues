Given an empty stack, what will be the contents of the stack after the
following operations? (Hint: When you have a method inside another method call (e.g., this(that()), that()
will be executed first, afterwards this() will be executed)
• push(8)
8
• push(2)
2, 8
• pop()
8
• push(pop()*2)
16
• push(10)
10, 16
• push(pop()/2)
5, 16

Given an empty queue, what will be the contents of the stack after the
following operations? (Hint: When you have a method inside another method call (e.g., this(that()), that()
will be executed first, afterwards this() will be executed)
• push(4)
4
• push(pop()+4)
8
• push(8)
8, 8
• push(pop()/2)
4, 8
• pop()
4
• pop()
empty

We discussed that using a doubly-linked list, you are able to search an
element in O(n/2), the same is true for a deque.
Given a Deque q and an element y, provide an algorithm that finds the position in the deque in which
element x is stored in O(n/2).

function findPositionInDeque(deque, x):
    left = 0
    right = deque.size() - 1

    while left <= right:
        if deque[left] == x:
            return left
        if deque[right] == x:
            return right

        left++
        right--

    return -1 // not in deque
